# SIP-VoIP-call-implementations-in-Linux-OS-

The objective of this project is to learn the implementation of Voice over IP (VoIP) using SIP connections through
a hands-on experiment over Ad-Hoc networks. The learning process is carried out by utilizing a server and a few
VoIP users as clients. The server uses Asterisk software. 

This particular report contains the virtual machine approach, and not the ad hoc approach.

## Call Scenarios:

1. Call between two sip clients
2. Busy User
3. Call on Hold
4. Conference Call
